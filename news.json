		"The theme for this issue is Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAMs). These historic and diverse medical practices—although given little focus in our curriculum—have emerged as an important topic in healthcare due to controversies over their use. Debates and ethical quandaries arise when addressing the role of these practices in our society and the limited knowledge of patients and physicians regarding the safety and efficacy of these practices. This controversy gives rise to litigations wherein patients opt for alternative medicines over conventional options. Specifically as future health care professionals, we should be informed about the interplay of CAMs and conventional Western medicines."
